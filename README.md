# Visualization Project - European gold reserves

## Overview
This is a project conducted by three IMT Mines Ales students for a Dataviz class.
<br>
This projet aims to analyze the evolution from 2000 to 2014 of each European country's gold reserves, through data visualization techniques.
<br>
You can find [the original dataset](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/reserves-officielles-de-28-pays-europeens/) on a French government's website : data.gouv.fr.
<br>
This repository gives the code of a [web application](https://estherjamet.github.io/Visualization-Project/) to interactively explore our results.
<br>
Here is an example of a visualization -a heatmap- on this website : ![fig1](www/interactive_heatmap.PNG)

Our data visualization project aims at studying and extracting the essential information about a given dataset in order to best describe all of the potential phenomenons induced by that dataset through data visualization techniques and methods. The chosen dataset deals with gold reserves within the European Union (E.U.) acquired on https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/reserves-officielles-de-28-pays-europeens. The said dataset 
This repository not only includes the said dataset under CSV format but also holds the code of the different plots and results that we have decided to show for explaining the heart of the matter of gold reserves in the E.U.

## How to use the application
The best way to use this application is by using [its online version](https://estherjamet.github.io/Visualization-Project/)
<br>
You can also clone the whole repository to use this application locally. Please note that in order to use the Rmarkdown document, you would have to previously install the library epuRate with devtools :
```
install_github("holtzy/epuRate", force=TRUE)
```
