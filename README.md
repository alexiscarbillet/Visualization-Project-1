# Visualization Project - European gold reserves

## Overview
This is a project conducted by three IMT Mines Alès students for a DataViz class.
<br>
This projet aims to analyze the evolution from 2000 to 2014 of gold reserves within the European Union (E.U.), through data visualization techniques and methods.
<br><br>
You can find [the original dataset](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/reserves-officielles-de-28-pays-europeens/) on a French government's website : data.gouv.fr.
<br><br>
This repository not only includes the said dataset (simplified version) under CSV format but also holds the code of the different plots and results that we have decided to show for explaining EU gold reserves.
This repository gives the code of a [web application](https://estherjamet.github.io/Visualization-Project/) to interactively explore our results. 
<br><br>
Here is an example of a visualization -a heatmap- provided on the website : ![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/estherjamet/Visualization-Project/master/interactive_heatmap.PNG)

## How to use the application
The best way to use this application is by using [its online version](https://estherjamet.github.io/Visualization-Project/)
<br><br>
You can also clone the whole repository to use this application locally. Please note that in order to use the Rmarkdown document, you would have to previously install the library epuRate with devtools :
```
install_github("holtzy/epuRate", force=TRUE)
```

## Authors
