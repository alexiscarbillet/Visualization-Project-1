# Visualization Project - European gold reserves
<br><br>

## Overview
This is a project conducted by three IMT Mines Ales students for a Dataviz class.
This projet aims to analyze the evolution from 2000 to 2014 of each European country's gold reserves, through data visualization techniques.
You can find the original dataset on a French government's website, [data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/reserves-officielles-de-28-pays-europeens/).
This repository gives the code of a [web application](https://estherjamet.github.io/Visualization-Project/) to interactively explore our results.

## How to use the application
The best way to use this application is via its [online version](https://estherjamet.github.io/Visualization-Project/)
